Throughout my attempted mastery of CSS, one of my most significant pain points has been dealing with margin between text elements. In this post, I will go over some of my previous approaches and the one approach I eventually landed on.

## Bottom margin only

First, I tried limiting myself to only using `margin-bottom`.

<p data-height="800" data-theme-id="32204" data-slug-hash="ppdOZN" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="taylorbryant" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Example #1 - Bottom margin only" className="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/taylorbryant/pen/ppdOZN/">Example #1 - Bottom margin only</a> by Taylor Bryant (<a href="https://codepen.io/taylorbryant">@taylorbryant</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" />

While this doesn't look awful, it introduces a couple of issues:

- The last paragraph in a section has an additional bottom margin.
- If you're like me and prefer more space between the last paragraph of a section and the next heading, you're out of luck.

## :first-child & :last-child selectors

Second, I tried modifying my code to account for any edge cases using `:first-child` and `:last-child` selectors.

<p data-height="800" data-theme-id="32204" data-slug-hash="YYEeMW" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="taylorbryant" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Example #2 - :first-child & :last-child selectors" className="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/taylorbryant/pen/YYEeMW/">Example #2 - :first-child & :last-child selectors</a> by Taylor Bryant (<a href="https://codepen.io/taylorbryant">@taylorbryant</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" />

This solves the issues introduced with the last approach. However, I can't help but get code smells, because:

1. `margin-top` is declared twice on heading elements
2. `margin-bottom` is declared twice on the paragraph element

## :not(:first-child) & :not(:last-child) selectors

By combining the `:not` selector with `:first-child` and `:last-child`, I was able to get rid of the excess code and land on my best approach yet.

<p data-height="800" data-theme-id="32204" data-slug-hash="dJZqjg" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="taylorbryant" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Example #3 - :not(:first-child) & :not(:last-child)" className="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/taylorbryant/pen/dJZqjg/">Example #3 - :not(:first-child) & :not(:last-child)</a> by Taylor Bryant (<a href="https://codepen.io/taylorbryant">@taylorbryant</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" />

## Takeaway

If you ever find yourself writing more CSS just to undo previous rules, it’s probably worth giving `:not` a shot. After my _margin epiphany_, I see myself applying this same concept to other aspects of my CSS every day.
