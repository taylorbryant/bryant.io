## 1. Rebuild my Tailwind CSS starters

When Tailwind CSS first came out, I got my feet wet by creating starter projects for Gatsby, Next.js, and Jekyll. I've made an effort to keep them updated over the years as Tailwind has grown (upgrading from Tailwind v1 to v2, swapping PurgeCSS with Tailwind's built-in `purge` option, etc.). However, the core piece of the projects have remained more or less the same. This year, I want to rebuild all 3 projects from the ground up and create a `create-next-app` equivalent for Tailwind CSS. There's an official `tailwindcss-setup-examples` repo, but it doesn't seem to be a priority for the team (understandably so).

## 2. Create educational content

## 3. Build a software product and launch it
