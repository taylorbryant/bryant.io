Throughout my attempted mastery of CSS, one of my most significant pain points has been dealing with margin between text elements. In this post, I will go over some of my previous approaches and the one approach I eventually landed on.

## Bottom margin only

First, I tried limiting myself to only using `margin-bottom`.

<iframe
  allowFullScreen
  allowtransparency="true"
  className="w-full mb-6 outline-none"
  frameBorder="no"
  height="500"
  scrolling="no"
  src="//codepen.io/taylorbryant/embed/ppdOZN/?height=500&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=3&editable=true"
  title="A simple demo showing an example of using only the margin-bottom CSS property to create space between typography elements"
/>

While this doesn't look awful, it introduces a couple of issues:

- The last paragraph in a section has an additional bottom margin.
- If you're like me and prefer more space between the last paragraph of a section and the next heading, you're out of luck.

## :first-child & :last-child selectors

Second, I tried modifying my code to account for any edge cases using `:first-child` and `:last-child` selectors.

<iframe
  allowFullScreen
  allowtransparency="true"
  className="w-full mb-6 outline-none"
  frameBorder="no"
  height="500"
  scrolling="no"
  src="//codepen.io/taylorbryant/embed/YYEeMW/?height=500&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=3&editable=true"
  title="A simple demo showing an example of using the margin-bottom CSS property with the :first-child and :last-child pseudo-selectors to create space between typography elements"
/>

This solves the issues introduced with the last approach. However, I can't help but get code smells, because:

1. `margin-top` is declared twice on heading elements
2. `margin-bottom` is declared twice on the paragraph element

## :not(:first-child) & :not(:last-child) selectors

By combining the `:not` selector with `:first-child` and `:last-child`, I was able to get rid of the excess code and land on my best approach yet.

<iframe
  allowFullScreen
  allowtransparency="true"
  className="w-full mb-6 outline-none"
  frameBorder="no"
  height="500"
  scrolling="no"
  src="//codepen.io/taylorbryant/embed/dJZqjg/?height=500&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=3&editable=true"
  title="A simple demo showing an example of using the margin-bottom CSS property with the :first-child, :last-child, and :not pseudo-selectors to create space between typography elements"
/>

## Takeaway

If you ever find yourself writing more CSS just to undo previous rules, itâ€™s probably worth giving `:not` a shot. After my _margin epiphany_, I see myself applying this same concept to other aspects of my CSS every day.
