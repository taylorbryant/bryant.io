            I first became interested in building on the web in elementary
            school. I made fan sites for a popular animated show called Dragon
            Ball Z. From elementary school to high school, I learned how to use
            WordPress, PHP, HTML, and CSS.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-xl leading-relaxed">
            When I graduated high school, I decided to enter the Computer
            Science program at the University of Memphis. There, I learned about
            object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms. While in
            school, I started working as a contract WordPress developer.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-xl leading-relaxed">
            After leaving college, I worked in IT support fulltime while
            continuing to make WordPress sites as a contractor on nights and
            weekends. I quickly realized I didn&apos;t want to work in IT for
            the rest of my life.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-xl leading-relaxed">
            In 2017, I moved into software development fulltime and started as a
            front-end developer at a local marketing agency called{` `}

            </a>
            . While working there, I helped build a number of custom websites
            for clients, the UI for a web app used internally at the company,
            and a proprietary template framework we used to cut down on
            development time. One of the custom websites I built{` `}

              won a WebAward

            .
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-xl leading-relaxed">
            At HigherVisiblity, I learned so much. I got proficient at CSS. I
            learned how to communicate with my teammates and how to translate
            design files to code.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-xl leading-relaxed">
            While working there, I felt an itch to learn newer technologies
            outside of WordPress and PHP. I spent nights and weekends learning
            JavaScript and I fell in love with React and the rest of the
            ecosystem.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-xl leading-relaxed">
            In 2018, I started working at Livestock Nutriton Center. During my
            time at the company, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to build several
            projects from the ground up and hone my skills as both a developer
            and a teammate.
